# bootstrap_scripts

Whenever I reinstall the OS (Operating System) for my PC (Personal Computer) I have to do several manual steps to setup my work environment. This repository contains scripts for those manual steps:
1. setup.sh: for macos and linux PC.
1. setup_rasp.sh: for raspbian.

## Install
```
bash setup.sh
```
